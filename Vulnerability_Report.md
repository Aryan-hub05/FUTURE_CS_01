# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Internship
Future Interns – Cyber Security Internship

---

## Objective
To identify common web application vulnerabilities in a legal testing website and provide clear remediation steps.

---

## Target Website
https://testphp.vulnweb.com  
(Legal and intentionally vulnerable testing website)

---

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- OWASP ZAP (Passive Scan)
- Browser Developer Tools

---

## Methodology

### Nmap Scan
Command used:
nmap -sV testphp.vulnweb.com

**Result:**
- Port 80 (HTTP) – Open
- Port 443 (HTTPS) – Open

---

### OWASP ZAP (Passive Scan)
Findings:
- Missing security headers
- Cookie security misconfiguration
- Information disclosure

---

### Manual Testing
- Input fields accept unsanitized data
- No visible client-side validation

---

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Missing Security Headers
- Risk Level: Medium
- Impact: Clickjacking and script injection
- Recommendation: Configure proper HTTP security headers

---

### 2. Insecure Cookies
- Risk Level: Medium
- Impact: Session hijacking
- Recommendation: Enable Secure and HttpOnly flags

---

### 3. Input Validation Issues
- Risk Level: Medium
- Impact: XSS and SQL Injection attacks
- Recommendation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs

---

## Risk Summary

| Vulnerability | Risk |
|--------------|------|
| Missing Headers | Medium |
| Insecure Cookies | Medium |
| Input Validation | Medium |

---

## Conclusion
The vulnerability assessment identified multiple medium-risk issues that could affect application security if left unpatched.
